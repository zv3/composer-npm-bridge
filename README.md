> This is a forked version of the **Composer NPM bridge** *composer* plugin which aims to solve the issue with having multiple `node_modules`, each one located underneath the composer vendor packages that got installed as dependency to a root *composer* based project, making it impossible for a standard nodejs setup to resolve, from the root project directory, the dependencies that got installed separately in each of these `node_modules` directories.

# Composer NPM bridge

*NPM integration for Composer packages.*

## Installation

- Available as [Composer] package [eloquent/composer-npm-bridge].

[composer]: http://getcomposer.org/
[eloquent/composer-npm-bridge]: https://packagist.org/packages/eloquent/composer-npm-bridge

## Requirements

- The `npm` executable must be available in PATH.

## Usage

To utilize the *Composer NPM bridge*, simply add `eloquent/composer-npm-bridge`
to the `require` section of the project's Composer configuration:

    composer require eloquent/composer-npm-bridge:^4

NPM dependencies are specified via a [package.json] configuration file in the
root directory of the Composer package. Source control should be configured to
ignore NPM's `node_modules` directory, similar to Composer's `vendor` directory.

[package.json]: https://npmjs.org/doc/json.html

## How does it work?

The *Composer NPM bridge* is a Composer plugin that automatically installs and
updates [NPM] packages whenever the corresponding Composer command is executed.
To detect compatible packages, the bridge inspects Composer package
configuration information to find packages that directly require the
`eloquent/composer-npm-bridge` Composer package itself.

In addition to normal operation, `composer install` will [install] NPM
dependencies for all Composer packages using the bridge. This includes the root
package, as well as Composer dependencies. Similarly, `composer update` will
[install] NPM dependencies for all Composer dependencies using the bridge. It
will also [update] the NPM dependencies for the root project.

NPM dependencies will be installed exactly as if `npm install` were run from the
root directory of the package. This applies even if the package is installed as
a dependency.

[npm]: https://npmjs.org/
[update]: https://npmjs.org/doc/update.html

## Caveats

Because NPM dependencies are installed underneath the root directory of the
Composer package, Composer may complain about working copy changes when the
package is installed as a dependency. Source control should be configured to
ignore the `node_modules` directory in order to avoid this.
